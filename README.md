# Valentine's Day Matchmaking Service ❤️

A fun and interactive web app designed to match students at Wellesley College based on their preferences. Built with **Flask** (backend) and **React** (frontend), this project allows users to answer a questionnaire and find their perfect match!

---

## Features ✨
- **Questionnaire**: Users answer 8 multiple-choice questions about their preferences.
- **Matching Algorithm**: Uses Euclidean distance to find the closest match.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends an email to users with their match’s details (optional).
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript) 
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Email Service**: Gmail SMTP 
- **Hosting**: PythonAnywhere

---

## How It Works 🧠
1. Users visit the website and answer a series of questions.
2. The backend calculates the Euclidean distance between the user’s answers and all other users’ answers.
3. The user with the smallest distance is selected as the match.
4. An email is sent to the user with their match’s details.
